My first Project since high school, in Scratch of all things. Nothing special...
Presents the user with a game to defeat Ego from Guardians of the Galaxy 2 through 5 levels.
Follow the prompt (space to start) and use arrow keys to move StarLord (pacman). 
There is an intro song, gameplay song, and victory song played at each respective stage of the game. 
I learned how to implement some different scripts through studying how Ivy's Hardest Game was designed.
